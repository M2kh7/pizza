          <li><b>Prepare the Dough:</b> If you're making your own dough, follow your favorite recipe or use store-bought
               dough. Allow the dough to come to room temperature and then roll it out on a floured surface until it
               reaches your desired thickness.</li>
          <li><b>Preheat the Oven:</b> Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go, usually around 475-500°F
               (245-260°C). Place a pizza stone or baking sheet in the oven while it preheats.</li>
          <li><b>Shape the Pizza:</b> Transfer your rolled-out dough to a pizza peel or parchment paper dusted with
               cornmeal. This will prevent it from sticking. Shape the dough into a circle, ensuring it's evenly
               stretched.</li>
          <li><b>Add Sauce and Toppings:</b> Spread a thin layer of pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border
               around the edges for the crust. Sprinkle shredded cheese evenly over the sauce, then add your favorite
               toppings.</li>
          <li><b>Bake the Pizza:</b> Carefully transfer the pizza to the preheated pizza stone or baking sheet in the
               oven. Bake for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbling and melted.
          </li>
          <li><b>Serve and Enjoy:</b> Once the pizza is done, remove it from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes
               before slicing. Serve hot and enjoy your delicious homemade pizza!</li>
     </ol>
     Voilà! Your pizza is ready to be savored!

     <h2 id="TIPS AND VARIATIONS">TIPS AND VARIATIONS</h2>
     <p> 
          <ul>
               <li>Experiment with different toppings to create your <b>own</b> unique pizza combinations.</li>
          <li>For a crispy crust, <b>pre-bake</b> the dough for a few minutes before adding sauce and toppings.</li>
          <li><b>Don't overload</b> your pizza with toppings, as this can make it soggy. Less is often more when it comes to pizza toppings.</li>
          </ul>
